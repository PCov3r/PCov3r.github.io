                <p> 
                Hey there, my name is Paul Devouge. I am a PhD student working full time at CEA Saclay. I have always been interested in Physics and
                Engineering. My passion for electronics started years ago. I like creating things and I have done many projects, from weather stations to
                embedded Machine Learning or even robots. <br> <br>

                I graduated from the Ecole Nationale Superieure de l'Electronique et Ses Applications, a French engineering school specialized in electronics, 
                computer science and telecommunications. During my third year, I studied at University College Cork, as part of a double degree
                in electrical and electronic engineering. My Master's Thesis was about parallel compliant robots, with the study and development
                of a 3RRR compliant planar parallel robot. <br> <br>
                
                I specialized in electronic engineering 
                and am currently doing research in particle physics, working on the CMS experiment at CERN. My thesis work consists both in a Physics
                analysis, and technical work. More particularely, I am working on the Level-1 Trigger for the CMS experiment, with embedded 
                distributed neural networks on FPGAs.
